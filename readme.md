# Ono, a DIY Open Source Social Robot (version 2)
Ono is a huggable, social robot for children. With 13 degrees of freedom, his face can express a wide range of emotions. Unlike other social robots, Ono is completely made using DIY techniques and low-cost materials. In fact, you can build an Ono yourself using the tools and materials that are available at your local FabLab!

We've created Ono for use in scientific research (human-robot interaction, robot-assisted therapy), as an alternative for existing robots, which often cost tens or even hundreds of thousands of euros. Ono not as advanced as other robots, but for many experiments only need basic functionality is needed. Because Ono can be built for less than 1000 euros, it's possible to do large scale experiments with many robots. With other social robots, the costs of large scale experiments are prohibitively expensive. In conclusion, Ono is a low-cost, "hackable" solution for social robotics research!

This repository contains all SolidWorks2013 and Rhinoceros design files of the robot.  
Software, patterns for textile skin, and electronics will be added at a later stage.
